  # Fix infinite recursion in users table RLS policies

  1. Problem
    - Current RLS policies on users table are causing infinite recursion
    - Policies are querying the users table from within users table policies
    - This creates circular dependency when checking admin permissions

  2. Solution
    - Drop the problematic recursive policies
    - Create simpler, non-recursive policies
    - Use direct auth.uid() checks where possible
    - Separate admin checks to avoid self-referencing

  3. Security Changes
    - Users can read/update their own profile via auth_user_id
    - Service role maintains full access for system operations
    - Organization members can read other members (non-recursive)
    - Admin operations will be handled at application level
*/

-- Drop the problematic recursive policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can manage organization users" ON users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Organization admins can manage users" ON users;

-- Keep the existing working policies:
-- "Service role full access" - already exists and works
-- "Users can manage own profile" - already exists and works  
-- "Users can read organization members" - already exists and works

-- Add a simple policy for organization-level user management
-- This avoids recursion by not checking user roles within the users table
CREATE POLICY "Organization members can read users"
  ON users
  FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING (
    organization_id IN (
      SELECT u.organization_id 
      FROM users u 
      WHERE u.auth_user_id = auth.uid()
      LIMIT 1
    )
  );

-- For admin operations (create, update, delete of other users),
-- we'll rely on application-level checks rather than RLS policies
-- to avoid the infinite recursion issue.
-- The application can verify admin status before making database calls.
