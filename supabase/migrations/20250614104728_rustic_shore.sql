/*
  # Fix infinite recursion in users table RLS policies

  1. Security Changes
    - Drop existing problematic RLS policies that cause infinite recursion
    - Create new, simplified RLS policies that don't create circular dependencies
    - Ensure users can access their own data and organization members safely

  2. Policy Changes
    - Replace complex subqueries with direct auth.uid() checks
    - Use simpler role-based access patterns
    - Avoid self-referencing queries in policy definitions

-- Split this into separate policies to avoid recursion
